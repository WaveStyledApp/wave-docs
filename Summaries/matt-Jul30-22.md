# Sitdown Summary - July 30th 2022 - Matt

Notes about work down on July 30th 2022. Primarily focused on exploring github pages and AWS. 

## Searx Engine and AWS exploration
- Had been looking into a search engine that I could use to scrap images from as most engines have their robots.txt which prevents it

- Using AWS free tier I deployed a EC2 server which is a cloud hosted VM. 

- Cloned the search engine and set it up for access. Could not figure out how to get SSL certificates working so the site says it is not secure, but its good enough for what I need to do.

- SSH'ing into the AWS is pretty simple, though setting up everything definitely required linux experience.

- Will share aws login creds asap

- https://ec2-54-163-183-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

### Next steps for Searx

- I can start building the scraper

## Github pages
- Created repo within the org for a github pages.
- Can use this site to host our documentation and keep each other updated on what we are working on
- Biggest drawback about using pages is we cannot create a private repo with it unless we are github pro, for now having this public should be fine

### Next steps for Github Pages

- I dont think there is a need to go write documentation for our exisiting code if there are going to be big changes, we can add as we go back and change.
