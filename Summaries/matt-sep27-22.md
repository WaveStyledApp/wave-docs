# Model stepback and testing research
Notes about work done on sep 27 22. Reached a bit of stuck point just at the end of path generation. Going to use this opprotunity to slow down a little and introduce some unit tests into the graph.

Using the unittest framework. [Found Here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). Pretty easy to write tests. Also has given me the opprotunity to restructure some stuff and clean up old code. Slowly adding comments for classes and funtions as well. 

If recommender keeps moving at this progress it will not be too long until I am ready to tie this into a database. At that point I might transition to looking at user management and creation + backend database. 

The only other sizable function that needs to be implemented is the method for altering weights of edges. This might end up being the most computationally heavy one as a lot of edges will need to be addressed. 

Not much else to upate on
