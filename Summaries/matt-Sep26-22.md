# Graph Work, some restructuring of docs, little bit of object stuff
Notes about work done on Sept 26 22. Added some load and save weight functions to the graph. Also out of curiousity plotted the graph. Not a huge day for work.

## Docs Notes

All the links on the main summaries page was starting to get a little cluttered, so I threw all my August ones into a single page. Pretty easy fix. 

## Object Rec Related stuff

Uploaded some cleaned images. Next step is to annotate them using [labelIMG](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg). 

- Note that this is a bitch to get working on M1 macs. Done easier on linux(and prob windows)

## Loading and Saving

For now i've just implemented saving the edges as 

- "start end weight" by line

saves it to a text file. Loading needed another function since the Edges start/end attributes hold the node object. So I added a function to find a Node based on pieceid. loading and saving happens pretty quickly. 

Saving all the edges generated by by wardrobe takes about 250KB, a decent amount but bothing insane. 


Could possibly be made smaller using an better method of storage???

## Visualizing graph

Nothing really interesting came out of this. I didnt really expect so either based off the number of edges we have(10+K).
