## Rebuilding for deployment, middle ware.

1. Remaining with SQL, need to find good method for AWS and SQL.

## Steps I have taken to accomplish this so far.
- Reconnected to EC2 instance via Terminal and got permission file on my working PC
- Created a RDS postgres DB on AWS and linked it with the EC2 instance
- Installed node on the EC2 instance
- setup git ssh for EC2
- Connected the RDS and EC2 together through a node backend. Can now start building out the backend again. 
## Next Steps

- Design user table and start looking into authentication, user creation.
